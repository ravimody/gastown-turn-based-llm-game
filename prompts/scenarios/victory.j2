${{ net_worth | currency }}.

You stare at the number, barely able to process it. After {{ turns }} weeks—{{ years }} years—of grinding, hustling, coding, and surviving the chaos of the AI boom, you've done it.

You're one of the winners.

{{ victory_type | default('Your path was winding. Side projects that failed. Jobs that didn't fit. Investments that paid off unexpectedly.') }}

You walk through {{ location | default('San Francisco') }} now with different eyes. The same streets where you once worried about rent now feel like possibilities. The same industry events where you were nobody, now people know your name.

{{ reflection | default('Was it worth it? The stress, the sacrifices, the relationships strained by your obsession?') }}

That's a question for another day. Today, you savor the win.

The Age of AI made you wealthy. What you do with that wealth—that's the next game.
