# Opening Scenario: The Age of AI: 2026

The California sun burns off the morning fog as you step off the Caltrain at Mountain View station. It's {{ month | default('March') }} {{ year | default('2026') }}, and Silicon Valley is pulsing with an energy you haven't felt since the dot-com days.

Every billboard advertises AI. Every coffee shop conversation is about models, parameters, and inference costs. The headline on someone's abandoned newspaper screams: "ANOTHER AI UNICORN: $2B VALUATION IN 6 MONTHS."

You check your phone. Bank balance: ${{ bank_account | default('5000') | currency }}.

It's not much, but it's enough. You're {{ player_name | default('an ML engineer') }} with skills, ambition, and a clear goal: reach ${{ goal | default('20000000') | currency }} net worth.

The path won't be easy. You'll write code until your eyes blur. You'll network at meetups, pitching ideas to strangers with more money than sense. You'll take side gigs, chase funding, maybe join a startup—or build your own.

{{ hype_description | default('The AI hype is everywhere. Investors are throwing money at anyone who can spell "transformer." But you know this cycle. You\'ve read about the winters.') }}

Somewhere in this madness is your opportunity. The question is: where do you start?
